In the realm of Alzheimer's disease prediction, the integration of advanced computational techniques, including deep learning, offers a transformative opportunity to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate early intervention. Our project aims to harness these methodologies to develop a robust system for Alzheimer's prediction, leveraging neuroimaging data and cognitive assessments such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

The specific objectives of our project are as follows:

Understanding and Analyzing Neuroimaging Data: Our primary objective is to comprehensively analyze neuroimaging data, particularly MRI scans, to extract meaningful insights about brain structure and potential biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease.
Building a Deep Learning Model: We endeavor to construct a sophisticated deep learning model, utilizing advanced architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to analyze neuroimaging data alongside patient demographics and MMSE scores. This model will be trained to classify individuals into distinct categories based on Alzheimer's disease status (e.g., Alzheimer's vs. normal), integrating cognitive assessments for enhanced diagnostic accuracy.
Incorporating MMSE Scores: An integral aspect of our project involves incorporating MMSE scores as a critical feature in our deep learning model. MMSE assessments provide valuable insights into cognitive impairment and will serve as an additional input for Alzheimer's prediction alongside neuroimaging data.
Development of Evaluation Metrics: We will establish a comprehensive evaluation framework using summary data derived from neuroimaging analyses and MMSE assessments. This framework will enable cross-verification and validation of the deep learning model's predictive performance, ensuring robustness and reliability.
Our overarching objective is to develop a sophisticated and reliable system capable of accurately classifying individuals as either having Alzheimer's disease or being cognitively normal, leveraging a holistic approach that integrates neuroimaging data, MMSE scores, and advanced deep learning methodologies. By leveraging cognitive assessments like the MMSE within the deep learning framework, we aim to advance diagnostic capabilities and pave the way for personalized interventions in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and management.

To create a reliable system that accurately classifies individuals with Alzheimer's disease or as non-demented using brain MRI images from diverse clinical datasets. This involves employing an advanced CNN model with transfer learning techniques and integrating cognitive testing for a comprehensive diagnostic approach.
